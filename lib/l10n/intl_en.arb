    "faqQuestion": "Is vibration in the ring dangerous for humans?",
    "faqAnswer": "No, such vibration cannot cause any harm to human health.",
    "faqQuestion1": "Can a person with a pacemaker use this ring?",
    "faqAnswer1": "Yes, they can. In 'vibration' mode, any intensity level can be used. In 'shocker' mode, a reduced intensity level should be used and consultation with a doctor is advised before use.",
    "faqQuestion2": "Why should I choose a ring instead of a wristband to use as an alarm or reminder?",
    "faqAnswer2": "Vibration in 'Wake-up' mode will provide you with a gentle and silent wake-up, and if that is not enough, the 'shocker' function will help you fully wake up. If you need the ring to vibrate, for example, every 15-20 seconds for an hour, you would need to set up more than 200 alarms on a smartwatch. This program can be set up in a few clicks in the ring's app.",
    "faqQuestion3": "How long does the ring hold a charge?",
    "faqAnswer3": "In average usage mode, it lasts for 15-20 hours.",
    "faqQuestion4": "Can I connect more than one ring to the app?",
    "faqAnswer4": "No.",
    "faqQuestion5": "What voltage does the shocker produce?",
    "faqAnswer5": "From 50V to 150V.",
    "faqQuestion6": "Is this voltage dangerous for human health?",
    "faqAnswer6": "No. The impact in 'shocker' mode is very brief and cannot harm a healthy organism.",
    "faqQuestion7": "What is the battery capacity?",
    "faqAnswer7": "50mA.",
    "faqQuestion8": "How long can the ring work without charging in standby mode?",
    "faqAnswer8": "Up to two days.",
    "faqQuestion9": "What is the ring's level of water resistance?",
    "faqAnswer9": "IPX4 means that the device is resistant to water only at the splash level. The ring can be worn on rainy days and during hand washing, but it cannot be submerged in water.",
    "faqQuestion10": "How will the ring work when it loses connection with the mobile app?",
    "faqAnswer10": "Only the basic settings programmed into the gadget will be saved. When the ring returns to the Bluetooth signal range of the mobile device, the settings of the previously set mode will be restored.",
